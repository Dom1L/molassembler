abstract = {We conduct an extensive computational study of shortest paths algorithms, including some very recent algorithms. We also suggest new algorithms motivated by the experimental results and prove interesting theoretical results suggested by the experimental data. Our computational study is based on several natural problem classes which identify strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms. These problem classes and algorithm implementations form an environment for testing the performance of shortest paths algorithms. The interaction between the experimental evaluation of algorithm behavior and the theoretical analysis of algorithm performance plays an important role in our research.},

@article{Flachsenberg2017,
abstract = {Many cheminformatics applications like aromaticity detection, SMARTS matching, or the calculation of atomic coordinates require a chemically meaningful perception of the molecular ring topology. The unique ring families (URFs) were recently introduced as a unique, polynomial, and chemically meaningful description of the ring topology. Here we present the first open-source implementation of the URF concept for ring perception. The C library RingDecomposerLib is easy to use, portable, well-documented, and thoroughly tested. Aside from the URFs, other related ring topology descriptions like the relevant cycles (RCs), relevant cycle prototypes (RCPs), and a smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) can be calculated. We demonstrate the runtime efficiency of the RingDecomposerLib with computing time benchmarks for the complete PubChem Compound Database and thereby show the applicability in large-scale and interactive applications.},

abstract = {The perception of a set of rings forms the basis for a number of chemoinformatics applications, e.g. the systematic naming of compounds, the calculation of molecular descriptors, the matching of SMARTS expressions, and the generation of atomic coordinates. We introduce the concept of unique ring families (URFs) as an extension of the concept of relevant cycles (RCs). URFs are consistent for different atom orders and represent an intuitive description of the rings of a molecular graph. Furthermore, in contrast to RCs, URFs are polynomial in number. We provide an algorithm to efficiently calculate URFs in polynomial time and demonstrate their suitability for real-time applications by providing computing time benchmarks for the PubChem Database. URFs combine three important properties of chemical ring descriptions, for the first time, namely being unique, chemically meaningful, and efficient to compute. Therefore, URFs are a valuable alternative to the commonly used concept of the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) and would be suited to become the standard measure for ring topologies of small molecules.},
