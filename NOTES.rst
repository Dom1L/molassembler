- Maybe it would have been best to originally use DynamicArrays everywhere with
  the maximum symmetry size or reasonable defaults. Consequentially could have
  done everything with much fewer template patterns... If any are exceeded it
  doesn't compile, so you're fine. Plus it could be stored homogeneously, which
  would be a huge plus
