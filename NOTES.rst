TODO
----

- Couldn't this be integrated with the symmetries library? A lot of the
  functionality is probably overlapping by now, and then I could have a
  constexpr list of what is the maximal amount of identical characters in a
  symmetry with which there is still asymmetry possible. (For work reduction in
  molecule ranking, if a terminal adjacent hydrogen count is easy to do)
- There must be a way to attain the weights associated with individual
  assignments, they would be FANTASTIC to have
  -> Have them now, need testing if they're being computed correctly!

- MORE TESTS
- Refactor
- Document
