TODO
----

- Finish Map.h
- current constructors of UpperTriangular force you to specify the size of the
  resulting matrix, but it could be inferred from the size of the array used for
  construction (and checked for correctness!)
- More vector operations? dunno if constant * Vector even works
- UpperTriangularMatrix could be way more useful -> add functionality
- Add more inverse trig
- Add more trig?
- transition to CMake
- make epsilon dependent on variable type
- make generic
- multiple algorithms for every problem -> investigate which are best in terms
  of numerical stability and speed
- tests

  - investigate numerical stability of the algorithms
  - compare against the STL algorithms
