Number of different structures when fitting all generated structures to first
structure, using visual inspection. Fault source: Some fits do not converge 
after 1000 iterations, and sometimes structures remain that are clearly 
superimposable (what gives?). All question marks indicate instances where fits 
do not converge or it is impossible to count the number of different structures.
