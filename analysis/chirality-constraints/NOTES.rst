How to run this analysis
------------------------
- Build the molecule library with the std::couts in AdjacencyList's
  inferStereocentersFromPositions uncommented.
- $ make
- $ make testdata
- $ ./a.out
- $ R -f analyze_single.R
- Look at the graphs

-------
- something is logically wrong. (FIXED)

  If I read a CN2 from a file, I want it to be remembered whether it was linear or
  bent. But no Stereocenters are instantiated for these cases since the number of
  unique assignments for linear and bent are each 1. The same is the case for size
  3 -> no output for Tshaped -> WHY?
  maximally asymmetric Tshaped should have several unique assignments!

  And they do, and they should, the issue was that stereocenter inference was
  based on the list generated by AdjacencyList's detectStereocenter, which
  disregarded any central atoms with 3 or fewer stereocenters. A different initial
  selection alleviated the problem.
