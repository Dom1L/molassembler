templated functions cannot be passed as template parameters to other functions
or objects, but turning them into functors that contain a commonly typed named
function allows you to circumvent this

expanding the tuple types into a template parameter pack is accomplished using
a combination of tuple_size, make_index_sequence and a single intermediate that
you pass the generated index sequence as an actual function parameter
