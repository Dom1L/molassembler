 * @brief Generate the set of rotationally unique stereopermutations for a given
 *   stereopermutation.
 *
 * By default does not remove trans-spanning groups (where a linked group's
 * directly bonded atoms span an angle of 180Â°).
 *
 * @note Gives NO guarantees as to satisfiability (if stereopermutation can be
 * fulfilled with real ligands)
 *
 * E.g. M (A-A)_3 generates a trans-trans-trans stereopermutation, which is extremely
 * hard to find actual ligands for that work.
 *
 * The satisfiability of stereopermutation must be checked before trying to embed
 * structures with completely nonsensical constraints. Perhaps restrict A-A
 * ligands with bridge length 4 (chelating atoms included), maybe even up to 6
 * to cis arrangements. Xantphos (with bridge length 7) is the smallest
 * trans-spanning ligand mentioned in Wikipedia.
