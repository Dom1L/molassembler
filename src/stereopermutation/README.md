# Geometry stereopermutation library
## Overview

Permits the representation of particular arrangements of substituents in 
specific shapes and the generation of all rotationally unique arrangements
with and without absolute occurrence counting.

Also includes linking between substituents. While tetrahedral AABB has only one
rotationally unique arrangement, (A-B)(A-B) has two.
