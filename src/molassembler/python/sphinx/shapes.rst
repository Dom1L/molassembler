Shapes
======

.. figure:: images/all_shapes.png

   All shapes that molassembler can classify from positions and treat
   permutationally. These are shapes from 2 vertices (line, bent) up to 12
   vertices (icosahedron, cuboctahedron).

   Shapes are classified into molecules by determining the nearest shape with
   a matching number of vertices.
