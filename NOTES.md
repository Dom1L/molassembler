# Notes

## Remaining failure in Minimal.h convexCircumcenter
- Probably due to too small upper bound. Hypothetically, a set of edge lengths
  whose sum excluding the longest edge is only a little bigger than the
  longest edge is feasible, but will have an enormous circumradius!
  (see angle scan plot)
