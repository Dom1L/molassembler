Molassembler
============

Molassembler is a C++ library that aims to facilitate crossings between
Cartesian and graph representations of chemical molecules. It provides the
necessary functionality to create a graph and stereocenters representation from
varying levels of information, modify it with stereocenter continuity, and
generate conformer ensembles.

This documentation aims to be a tutorial, not a developer's documentation of its
internals. It tries to enable a painless start to using the library through a
thorough summary of the encompassed concepts and models prior to introducing its
interface.
