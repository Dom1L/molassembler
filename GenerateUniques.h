 * NOTE: Gives NO guarantees as to satisfiability (if assignments can be
 *  fulfilled with real ligands) 
 * E.g. M (A-A)_3 generates a trans-trans-trans assignment, which is extremely 
 *  hard to find actual ligands for that work.
 * The satisfiability of assignments must be checked before trying to embed

 *  to cis arrangements. Xantphos (with bridge length 7) is the smallest
